<h1>Death of Myth</h1>
<p>&quot;Aristotle and Polybius, so defiant when they are confronting Myth,
did not believe in the historicity of Theseus or Aeolus, king of the 
wind, out of conformity or political calculation. Nor did they seek to 
challenge myths, but only to rectify them. Why rectify them? Because 
nothing that does not presently exist is worthy of belief. But then, why 
not challenge it all? Because the Greeks never admitted that the 
mythmaking process could lie to everyone about everything. The 
ancient problematic of myth, as we will see, is bounded by two 
dogmas that were unconscious, for they were self-evident. It was 
impossible to lie gratuitously, or lie about everything to everyone, for 
knowledge is only a mirror; and the mirror blends with what it reflects, 
so that the medium is not distinguished from the message.&quot;</p>

<p>Paul Veyne writes the above in the fourth chapter of his essay 
&quot;Did the Greeks Believe in Their Myths?&quot; While very clear, I feel 
it must be said that the detraction of hyperboles from myths is the catalyst for 
absolutism in scientific belief. It is natural to denigrate the cultural
importance of legends when we begin to dull the impact of storytelling by 
subjugating its elements with the exactness we require of the scientific method.</p>

<p>When we ground tall tales in reality and subject them to the laws of physics,
we lose the wisdom of knowing paradoxical truth. I think there is beauty
in total belief of stories whose absurdity match the imagination of children
and whose basis we know down to the fibers of our heart hold true.</p>
